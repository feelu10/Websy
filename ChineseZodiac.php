    <h1>The Fascinating History of the Chinese Zodiac</h1>
    <p>
      The Chinese zodiac is a traditional classification scheme based on the Chinese calendar that assigns an 
      animal and its reputed attributes to each year in a repeating twelve-year cycle. Originating from China,
      the zodiac and its variations remain popular in many East Asian and Southeast Asian countries, such as 
      Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Nepal, Bhutan, Cambodia, and Thailand.
    </p>

    <h2>Symbols of Life and Personality</h2>
    <p>
      Identifying this scheme using the generic term "zodiac" reflects several superficial similarities to the Western zodiac:
      both have time cycles divided into twelve parts, each labels at least the majority of those parts with names of animals, 
      and each is widely associated with a culture of ascribing a person's personality or events in their life to the supposed 
      influence of the person's particular relationship to the cycle.
    </p>

    <h2>Unique Traits and Significance</h2>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, there are major differences between the two: the animals of the Chinese zodiac are not associated with 
      constellations spanned by the ecliptic plane. The Chinese twelve-part cycle corresponds to years, rather than months. 
      The Chinese zodiac is represented by twelve animals, whereas some of the signs in the Western zodiac are not animals, 
      despite the implication of the etymology of the English word zodiac, which derives from zōdiacus, the Latinized form of 
      the Ancient Greek zōdiakòs kýklos (ζῳδιακός κύκλος), meaning "cycle of animals".
    </p>

    <h2>Ancient Wisdom and Culture</h2>
    <p>
      The records from the excavated ancient bamboo books have proved the existence of the Chinese zodiac before 
      the Qin Dynasty (221 – 207 BC), and the complete 12 animals’ cycle had been set before or during the 
      Eastern Han Dynasty (25 – 220 AD). Some people believe that the 12 Chinese zodiac animals are simplified 
      from the 28 animals which represent 28 constellations in ancient Chinese astronomy, while some insist the 
      zodiac’s relationship with Jupiter’s revolution period just about 12 years. The most popular is the totem 
      saying of the origin related to animal worship.
    </p>

    <p>The Chinese zodiac is a 12-year cycle, and each year is associated with one of the 12 animals.
        The animals are said to have different personality traits and characteristics,, and people born in the year of a particular animal
          are said to share some of those traits. For example, people born in the year of the Rat</h4>
            are said to be resourceful and clever, while people born in the year of the Dragon are said to be powerful and ambitious.</h4>
            <br>
        The Chinese zodiac is a popular system of astrology in East Asia, and it is also
        used in other parts of the world.
        often use their Chinese zodiac sign to 
        learn more about their 
        personality and to make predictions about their future.
